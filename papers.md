## Papers
Here are a few papers that I helped with that have been published. Because most of my papers involve writing code that is essentially malware, so I do not include source code on GitHub.
 - [Parlermonium: A Data-Driven UX Design Evaluation of the Parler Platform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00163)
 - [TrollHunter2020: Real-time Detection of Trolling Narratives on Twitter During the 2020 U.S. Elections](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3445970.3451158)
