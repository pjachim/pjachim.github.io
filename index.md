I am a data scientist and a PhD student at DePaul University. I am doing research on the intersection between data science and information warfare. My specialties include computational linguistics, machine learning, creative applications for factor analyses, and web-scraping. 

Outside of research, I work in the automitive/trucking industry, and have industry experience in utilities and medical devices/healthcare.

# Packages
I am trying to imagine an ecosystem of ML tools that are not based on LLMs (though I am not opposed to the use of them either).

I am actively developing three tools:
 - [Bukka](https://github.com/pjachim/Bukka) - A ML project framework (inspired by django) that automates the boring stuff of setting up reproducibility and infrastructure to enable data scientists to quickly get started on doing the fun parts of the problem as efficiently as possible.
 - [NandorAPI](https://github.com/pjachim/NandorAPI) - Efficient tools for helping to quickly build an API client on an arbitrary API.
 - *Untitled Project Coming Soon* - A package of overlooked sklearn-compatible machine learning models, focusing on performant small models.
