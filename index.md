I am a data scientist and a PhD student at DePaul University. I am doing research on the intersection between data science and information warfare. My specialties include computational linguistics, machine learning, creative applications for factor analyses, and web-scraping. 

Outside of research, I have a background in medical devices/healthcare, and utilities.
