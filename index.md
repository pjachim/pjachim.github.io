I am a data scientist and a PhD candidate at DePaul University. I am doing research on the intersection between data science and information warfare. My specialties include computational linguistics, machine learning, creative applications for factor analyses, and web-scraping. 

Outside of my research, I have a background in medical devices/healthcare, and utilities. 

## Scripts
 - [Word2Vec to Explore Adverse Events](https://github.com/pjachim/fda-adverse-event-analysis/blob/main/Word2Vec%20Notebook.ipynb) training and querying a Word2Vec model of adverse events. 
 - [Text-Summarization of *Riders of the Purple Sage*](https://github.com/pjachim/riders-of-the-purple-sage-analysis/blob/main/Auto-Summarization.ipynb) quick implementation of a rules-based extractive text summarization of the chapters of *Rider's of the Purple Sage* by Zane Grey.
 - [Collecting FDA Adverse Event Data](https://github.com/pjachim/fda-adverse-event-analysis/Collect%20Adverse%20Event%20Data.ipynb) A script used to download adverse event reports from the FDA.
 - [HIPAA Breach Analysis](https://github.com/pjachim/HIPAA_Breach_Classification/blob/master/HIPAA%20Breach%20Classification.ipynb) this is a project I did a couple of years ago as I was starting my Master's studies.

## Papers
Here are a few papers that I helped with that have been published. **Note: most of my papers involve writing code that is essentially malware, so I do not include source code on GitHub.**
 - [Parlermonium: A Data-Driven UX Design Evaluation of the Parler Platform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00163)
 - [TrollHunter2020: Real-time Detection of Trolling Narratives on Twitter During the 2020 U.S. Elections](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3445970.3451158) (This is a link to ACM).
